# Implementation-of-VGG16-Architecture

## Overview
This is a keras implementation of VGG16 model based on keras. VGG16 is a type of CNN (Convolutional Neural Network). It is an object detection and classification algorithm which is able to classify 1000 images of 1000 different categories and one of the popular algorithms for image classification.

## Purpose
The purpose of this model is classification of handwritten digits. Using keras library, the VGG16 model recognizes the image into one of the 10 digits.

## Source
The project was implemented using the Modified National Institute of Standards and Technology (MNIST) handwritten digit dataset. 

This project was implemented on the kaggle platform. Here's the [link](https://www.kaggle.com/code/jatinmotwani12/implementation-of-vgg16-v2) for the notebook.

## Training Statistics
